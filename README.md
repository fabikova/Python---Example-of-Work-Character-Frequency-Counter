HW01: Character Frequency Counter

This Python script reads Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (alice.txt), counts the frequency of each character, and outputs the results to hw01_output.json.

Functionality:
Case-Insensitive Counting: Counts each character regardless of case and ignores spaces and new lines.
Output: Saves results as a JSON file, with characters sorted alphabetically for readability.
